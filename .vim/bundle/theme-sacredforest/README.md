### Installation ###

Install manually or with your favorite plug-in manager and then load the theme.

With `vim-plug`:

```VimL
Plug 'KKPMW/sacredforest-vim'
colorscheme sacredforest
```

The colorscheme will work with 256 color terminals but the results might
not be satisfactory. Therefore where available it is recommended to set `termguicolors`.

```VimL
set termguicolors
```
